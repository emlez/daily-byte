// Create a class CallCounter that tracks the number of calls a client has made within the last 3 seconds. Your class should contain one method, ping(int t) that receives the current timestamp (in milliseconds) of a new call being made and returns the number of calls made within the last 3 seconds.
// Note: you may assume that the time associated with each subsequent call to ping is strictly increasing.

// Ex: Given the following calls to pingâ€¦

// ping(1), return 1 (1 call within the last 3 seconds)
// ping(300), return 2 (2 calls within the last 3 seconds)
// ping(3000), return 3 (3 calls within the last 3 seconds)
// ping(3002), return 3 (3 calls within the last 3 seconds)
// ping(7000), return 1 (1 call within the last 3 seconds)

class CallCounter {
  private calls: number[] = []

  ping(t: number): number {
    this.calls.push(t)
    while (this.calls[0] < t - 3000) {
      this.calls.shift()
    }
    return this.calls.length
  }
}

const callCounter = new CallCounter()

console.log(callCounter.ping(300))
